<H3>GRAVES & MONUMENTAL INSCRIPTIONS </H3>
<p>
The Register which follows has been compiled from four
principal sources:<br>
a)  A plan of -the Meeting House and Burial Grounds
prepared at the time of the creation of the ....
Trust Deed together with a partly completed Schedule
of those persons buried in the Old Burial Ground
MS DL23<br>
b)  A pencil sketch, undated, by an unknown hand and
entitled 'The Floor of the Chapel before being boarded'
and giving some details of the grave stones exposed
at that time MS BL48 <br>
c)  A record of gravestone inscriptions compiled by
Miss Emily Cooke (1852-1921) from personal observation
and using an earlier record of inscriptions made by
Colonel F W T Attree.  This record was loaned to the
Transcriber by her kinswoman Miss Jessie Read.  It is
referred to hereafter as MS DL107 <br>
d)  A visual check of all surviving gravestones a-nd
memorial tablets by the Transcriber and members of
his family <br>
</p>
<p>
The numbering system used to identify graves in the Old
Burial Ground is that found in the 1854 plan.  Elsewhere
the numbering system is that of the Transcriber.  A plan
at the end of this volume locates the position of each
individual grave by number. </P>
<p>
The Burial Register, up to 1837 and when referring to the
New Burial Ground, generally locates the grave by the
distance in feet/inches from the East and South walls.
vftien referring to the latter, it should be remembered
that, in 1849 the South wall was moved some 12 feet or
so right up to tha boundary of the property </P>

The Register entries are in five groups: <br>
