<H3>REGISTER OF BIRTHS</H3>
<p>
In the 17th century Parish Registers tended to be records
of baptisms rather than of births.  The General Baptists
did. not practise infant baptism.  There was a reluctance
amongst some Parish Clergy to enter births into their
registers even when requested to do so.  The result was
that in the early days of dissent few records of births
were kept other than in family bibles or journals.
</p><p>
As difficulties arose the inevitable consequence was the
creation of non-parochial registers of various kinds.
The Horsham Meeting began their own Register in 1724,
accepting entries from all who so requested including a
few entries from Ditchltng.  Another such Register was
that kept by Dr Williams's Library.
</p><p>
Tha keeping of a Register of Births for the Ditchling
Meeting seems to have been first raised in 1785 when it
was minuted: <i>
"Agreed that a Book be bought to Register Ghildrena
Names in when Born - To be done by H Browne " </i>
</p><p>
No action was taken possibly due to Henry Browne being
preoccupied with the setting up of a business in Lewes
with his partner William Crosskey.  Again in 1791 it
was minuted: <i>
" It is the wish of this Meeting that a Book be
bought to register Ghildrens names in - they
have therefore appointed Jas Browne to procure
the same and execute the business "   </i>
</p><p>
James Browne, a younger brother of Henry, was Secretary
to the Meeting.  Still no action was taken.
</p><p>
In 1803 Abraham Bennett, former Minister of the General
Baptist Meeting in Bishopsgata, was appointed Elder.
It was he who, in 1811, began the Register.  His first
entries wore those of his children born some years earlier.
</p><p>
Following the departure of Mr. Bennett to a ministry at
Poole arid the brief ministry of William Browne, the
Register was taken over by James Browne.  He made some
amends for his earlier inactivity by gathering and entering
details of some earlier births and thereafter keeping the
Register with his customary care.
</p><p>
George Withall was appointed Minister in 1852 for by this
time the term 'Elder' had been quietly dropped.  Thereafter
the Register was in his hands though few entries were made.
</p><p>
In 1837 there came into operation the Act of 3 & 4 Vict
cap 92 relative to the General Registration of Births,
Marriages and Deaths.  Amongst the provisions of this Act,
all non-parochial registers were to be deposited in the
General Register Office.  This was duly done and the
Ditchling Register of Births is now to be found in the
Public Record Office, manuscript RG4 1796.
</p><p>
The Register is a large book.  Most of the pages are
unused.  On the flyleaf is pasted a Return evidently made
before it, along with the Deaths Register, was deposited.
In the Return, George Vithall certifies, inter alia:
<i>
'I am the Minister of the General Baptist Chapel
Ditchling
The principal acting trustees are John Wood,
Jesse Kense-fct, Edward Turner, all of Ditchling
The Register of Burials at the Burial Ground of
the General Baptist Chapel, Cuckfield has been
kept by Mr James Walder of Long Acre House,
Cuckfield'</i>
</p><p>
A copy of the Register was made before the original was
deposited.  This copy has survived though in a somewhat
mutilated cond.ition.  No subsequent Register was kept.
The new Act rendered it unnecessary.
</p><p>
In making the transcription of the Register of Births
some simplification of format has been adopted
together with some abbreviations, viz:

<p>
The Register entries are numbered 1 to 62 but with a gap
between 16 and 25. The last entry was in 1852. The
nntries appear to cover only a small, proportion of the
births of children to members of the Church.
