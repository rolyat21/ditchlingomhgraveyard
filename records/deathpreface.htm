<H3>REGISTER OF DEATHS AND BURIALS</H3>
<p>
This has been compiled from a number of sources.
Firstly there is the Register covering the period 1821 to 1837
which was deposited in the General Register Office along with
the Register of Births under the 1837 Act and now held by the
Public Record Office, Document No KG4 1797.  The 68 entries
in this Register have been transcribed using a simplified
format as was done for the Register of Births. </P>
<P>
Secondly there is an additional Register held in the Meeting
House archives (MS DL6).  It begins with a copy of the 68
entries of the original Register and then carries on, the last
entry being dated February 1950.     </P>
<p>
This second Register bears the Imprint of many hands, both in
the original entries and in corrections or additions added by
later hands.  The title of the Register changes as time goes
on.  The original flyleaf reads:
'Register of Ditchling General Baptist Chapel Burials' .
The outer cover, in a later hand reads:
'Register of Chapel Burials' .
A later brown paper dust cover bears the title:
'Ditchling Free Christian Church Burials' </p>
<p>
There are a number of gaps in the Register suggesting that it
was lost or was inaccessable to those officiating at funerals
for some periods.  Some of the gaps were noted in a list in
the handwriting of Miss Emily Cooke entitled 'Burials not.
entered in Register - On Stones' (lMS DL99) and citing 24 names.
For ease of reference tills information has been added to the
Register as transcribed, in date order and marked *.
No attempt has been made to add details of Deaths and Burials
before 1821 when the original Register was started.  Where
such information is available, it will be found in the
Register of Graves and Monumental Inscriptions or the
Supplementary List.     </p>
