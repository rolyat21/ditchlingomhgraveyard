This site has been prepared to assist
students of this and future generations
who may be studying the history of the
Old Meeting House at Ditchling, the
genealogy of their families or other
related matters.
</P>
<p>
As more information comes to light so the
site may need to be amended or extended.
This the compiler hopes to do if needed.
The present information should thus be considered
an interim one.
</p>
<p>
The compiler would welcome advice from
any reader who has additional information
on the subject and which might serve to
make a future edition more useful.
It is hoped that such a future edition
will be supplemented by genealogical
trees of the larger families whose names
appear here.  Substantial progress
has been made in the compilation of these
trees, but they are at present insufficiently
complete to warrant publication with
this site</p>
<p>
Most of the persons whose names appear in the
records which follow were members, or descendants
of members of what was once a relatively closed
community.  To understand why this community
existed and why these people chose to belong to
such a community, it is necessary to look back
into history.
</P>
<p>
The early years of the reign of Queen Elizabeth
were ones of stability and consolidation.  The
Church had been rid of its worst corruption and
superstition in the time of her father, had
swung to one extreme, so it was argued, in the
reign of her brother, had swung to the opposite
extreme under her sister to the revulsion of
most people in the country, but was now treading
a steady middle path.  The Book of Common Prayer
had been re-established and had found general
acceptance.  The Bible, now widely available,
was having a profound influence on the people
who regarded it as the ultimate measure of what
was right and wrong in things spiritual.  The
Government was firm, and if justice was a little
rough at times, the fears of enemies abroad and
conspiracy at home rendered it acceptable.
</p><p>
Such conditions could not last as the country
became more settled.  The revulsion against the
spiritual bondage of the past was deeply ingrained
in many people, lay and clergy.  They saw the
pride and wealth of the bishops, the vestments
of the Church, and many passages in the Book of
Common Prayer as savouring of popery.
</P>
<p>
The more thoughtful clergy, commonly known as
'Puritans', began to give no more than lip
service to the church establishment.  They
preached without vestments.  They baptised
without the sign of the cross.
When John Whitgift was appointed Archbishop
of Canterbury he had a firm directive from the
Queen to enforce conformity.  The Puritan
party came under persecution, but to no avail,
for two generations later their strength had
grown such that crown and bishops were swept
away.
</p>
<p>
There were some clergy whose minds followed a
more radical path.  Whereas the Puritans
sought to purify rather than destroy the
Church of England, these other minds, by dint
of deep study of the bible, found no
scriptural authority for an established church.
Moreover they found many of the practices of
the church as contravening the scriptures.
They concluded that when two or more were
gathered together in the name of Jesus Christ,
there was the true church.  It was that church
and no other, that should appoint Elders for
their spiritual uplifting, Deacons for their
temporal support, and Messengers for spreading
the Gospel.
</p>
<p>
Some took a step further.  Admission to the
true church could only be as a result of belief
in the teachings of Jesus, repentence for past
sins and the washing away of those sins by
baptism.  Baptism of infants was meaningless
and without any scriptural authority.
</p>
<p>
Such people were originally called 'Anabaptists'
as a mark of decision though, in time, they
accepted the name 'Baptists'.
</p><p>
At that time the teaching of Calvin was becoming
widely accepted throughout much of Europe and
England.  It taught, amongst other things, that
salvation was limited to a predestined few and
that the bulk of mankind was lost through the
sins of Adam.  Most Baptists found this view
quite unacceptable.  They considered salvation
was available to all and general who diligently
sought it.  From this tenet they becajne known
as 'General Baptists' and it is from these that
the Ditchling Meeting House people trace their
origin.
</p>
<p>
Baptists suffered much persecution, both the
General Baptists and those who held to the
Galvinist view and were known as 'Particular
Baptists'.  Those caught practising adult
baptism risked imprisonment or even death.  The
hoped for improvement in these conditions on
the death of Elizabeth failed to materialise.
A number fled to Holland and it was in Amsterdam
in about 1609 that the first English Baptist
Church was formally constituted.
</p><p>
A few years later, uneasy at the thought of
accepting a safe refuge rather than facing troubles
at home, the church leaders returned to England
eventually to die in prison.  Not till the time
of the Civil War did conditions in England
allow Baptists and others separated from the
Church of England to worship in peace.  Sadly,
with the restoration of Charles II, persecution
began once more.  It was not till the Glorious
Revolution of 1680 which placed William and
Mary on the throne that religous persecution
virtually came to an end.
</p><p>
Persecution for 100 years or so had left
its mark on the Baptists, as with others.
Secrecy of worship had been essential for
long periods.  Any stranger might be an
informer.  Thus the custom arose of
intermarriage between Baptist families,
a custom often enforced by threat of
exclusion from their communion.
</p><p>
The records which follow, even though
relating mainly to persons living long
after persecution had ceased, still show
extensive intermarriage between the old
families, at least up to the early 1800s
by which time the old customs had almost
died.
</P>
<p>
So too by then had some of the old beliefs.
From its inception the movement had a strong
aversion to any written creed or statement
of faith other than in the most general
terms.  Their only authority was the
written word of the bible and this, in
strict terms, meant the Greek and Hebrew
originals.  As modern biblical criticism
arose so their approach to the bible was
affected.  Some, troubled by the new
thinking, had moved to Methodism or across
to the Particular Baptists.  Some, despairing
of the religous and political climate in
England had moved to America.
